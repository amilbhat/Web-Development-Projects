# Simple Node.js Project Starter

This Node.js script is a simple project starter that creates a basic project folder structure with empty HTML, JavaScript, and CSS files. You can use it to kickstart your web development projects quickly.

## How to Use

1. Make sure you have Node.js installed on your system.

2. Download or clone this script.

3. Open your terminal or command prompt.

4. Navigate to the directory where you saved this script.

5. Run the script with the following command:

```bash
node script.js [folderName]
```

- Replace `[folderName]` with the name of your project folder (optional). If you don't provide a folder name, it will default to 'Project'.

6. After running the script, you will find a new folder with the specified name (or 'Project' if not provided) containing three empty files: `index.html`, `script.js`, and `style.css`.
